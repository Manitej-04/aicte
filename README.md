# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically **Logistic Regression**. The work was completed as part of a virtual internship focused on real-world applications of Artificial Intelligence in financial technology.

## 🎓 Internship Context

This project was developed as part of the **Edunet - Microsoft Foundation Artificial Intelligence 4 Weeks Internship (April 2025 Batch)**. 

> “We are pleased to inform you that you have been shortlisted for the Edunet - Microsoft Foundation Artificial Intelligence Internship at Edunet Foundation. Your qualifications and experiences stood out among many impressive candidates.”  
— *Edunet Foundation Internship Team*

This internship, conducted in partnership with **AICTE and Microsoft**, emphasizes practical learning in:
- Python and data handling
- Building AI/ML models using Scikit-learn
- Evaluating models with industry-grade metrics
- Presenting data insights effectively

## 📁 Project Files

- `confusion_matrix.png` – Visualization showing the model’s confusion matrix.
- `actual_vs_predicted.png` – Comparison of actual vs predicted fraud counts.
- `precision_recall_curve.png` – Precision-recall graph with an AUC score of 0.98.

## 🧠 Model Information

- **Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Framework**: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- **Dataset**: Balanced version of credit card transactions to address class imbalance.

## 📊 Performance Summary

- **Precision**: 89.8%
- **Recall**: 94.6%
- **F1 Score**: 0.92
- **AUC (Precision-Recall)**: 0.98

These metrics indicate a highly effective model that minimizes false negatives — a key requirement in fraud detection systems.

## ✅ Key Learnings

- Handling imbalanced datasets effectively.
- Using evaluation tools like confusion matrix and PR curves.
- Interpreting model performance with real-world implications.
